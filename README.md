# kivymd-modern-video-player

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Hereâ€™s a fully customizable video player built with KivyMD that I put together. Itâ€™s cross-platform, so you can use it on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Itâ€™s designed with a clean, modern UI and has loads of options for customization. You get all the essentials like playback controls, dynamic sliders, synced timestamps, and tons of styling options to make it your own. There are even advanced features like shaders and time-based animations for those looking to do more! Perfect for building your own video app or experimenting with video projects.
